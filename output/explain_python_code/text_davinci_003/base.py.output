    Here's what the above code is doing:
    1.
    We are creating a dataclass called Message which has two attributes, user and text.
    2.
    We are creating a dataclass called Conversation which has one attribute, messages.
    3.
    We are creating a dataclass called Config which has three attributes, name, instructions, and example_conversations.
    4.
    We are creating a dataclass called Prompt which has three attributes, header, examples, and convo.
    5.
    We are creating a function called render which takes in a Prompt object and returns a string representation of the Prompt.
