Here's what the above code is doing:
1.
The moderate_message() function takes in a message and a user and returns a tuple of flagged_str and blocked_str. It uses the OpenAI API to check the message for any offensive content and returns the flagged and blocked strings based on the results.

2.
The fetch_moderation_channel() function takes in a guild and returns the moderation channel associated with it.

3.
The send_moderation_flagged_message() function takes in a guild, user, flagged_str, message, and url and sends a message to the moderation channel with the flagged content.

4.
The send_moderation_blocked_message() function takes in a guild, user, blocked_str, and message and sends a message to the moderation channel with the blocked content.
