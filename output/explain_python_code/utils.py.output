Here's what the above code is doing:
1.
The discord_message_to_message function takes a DiscordMessage object and returns a Message object. This is used to convert a Discord message into a Message object that can be used by the bot.

2.
The split_into_shorter_messages function takes a string and splits it into shorter messages that can be sent in a reply.

3.
The is_last_message_stale function checks if the last message sent in a thread is stale. This is used to determine if the bot should respond to a message or not.

4.
The close_thread function takes a discord.Thread object and closes the thread. This is used to close threads when the context limit is reached.

5.
The should_block function takes a discord.Guild object and checks if the guild is allowed to use the bot. This is used to prevent the bot from being used in servers that are not allowed.
