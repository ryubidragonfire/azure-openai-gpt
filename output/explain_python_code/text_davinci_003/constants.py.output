    Here's what the above code is doing:
    1.
    We're loading the config.yaml file, which contains all the configuration settings for our bot.
    2.
    We're setting up the environment variables for our bot, such as the Discord Bot Token, the Discord Client ID, and the OpenAI API Key.
    3.
    We're setting up the list of allowed server IDs, which is used to restrict the bot to certain servers.
    4.
    We're setting up the dictionary of server IDs to moderation channels, which is used to send moderation messages to the appropriate channels.
    5.
    We're setting up the bot invite URL, which is used to invite the bot to a server.
    6.
    We're setting up the moderation values for blocked and flagged messages, which are used to determine how severe a message is.
    7.
    We're setting up the seconds delay for receiving messages, which is used to give the bot time to process multiple messages.
    8.
    We're setting up the maximum number of messages in a thread, which is used to limit the number of messages in a thread.
    9.
    We're setting up the activate and inactivate thread prefixes, which are used to indicate whether a thread is active or not.
    10.
    We're setting up the maximum characters per reply message, which is used to limit the length of messages sent by the bot.
