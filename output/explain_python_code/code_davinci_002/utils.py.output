    Here's what the above code is doing:
    1.
    if guild is None:
        # dm's not supported
        logger.info(f"DM not supported")
        return True
    This is checking if the guild is None. If it is, it means that the message was sent in a DM.
    If it was sent in a DM, we don't want to respond to it, so we return True.
    2.
    if guild.id and guild.id not in ALLOWED_SERVER_IDS:
        # not allowed in this server
        logger.info(f"Guild {guild} not allowed")
        return True
    This is checking if the guild.id is not in the ALLOWED_SERVER_IDS list. If it isn't, we don't want to respond to it, so we return True.
    3.
    return False
    If the message was not sent in a DM and the guild.id is in the ALLOWED_SERVER_IDS list, we return False.
